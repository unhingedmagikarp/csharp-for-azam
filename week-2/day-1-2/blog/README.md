- Reuse your `BlogPost` class
- Create a `Blog` class which can:
  - store a list of BlogPosts
  - and has the following methods:
    - `add(BlogPost)` -> adds a BlogPost to the list
    - `delete(int)` -> deletes the BlogPost from the given index
    - `update(int, BlogPost)` -> replaces an item at the given index
    with a new BlogPost
