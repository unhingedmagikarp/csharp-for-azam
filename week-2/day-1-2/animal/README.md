# Animal

- Create an `Animal` class
  - Every animal has a `hunger` value, which is a whole number
  - Every animal has a `thirst` value, which is a whole number
  - When creating a new animal instance these values must be set to the
    default `50` value
  - Every animal can `eat()` which decreases its hunger by one
  - Every animal can `drink()` which decreases its thirst by one
  - Every animal can `play()` which increases both its hunger and thirst by one
