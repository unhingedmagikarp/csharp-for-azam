# Max Sum

Create a function called `maxSum` which expects an array of five integers as an
input parameter and returns the maximum values that can be calculated by summing
exactly four of the five integers.

## Examples

```text
[1 2 3 4 5] -> 14
```

We can calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:

```text
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12
1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13
2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14 ✨
```
